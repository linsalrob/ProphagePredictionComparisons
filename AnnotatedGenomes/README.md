# Manually Annoated Genomes

Once you have manually annotated a genome, please feel free to drop it here. You should be able to just drag and drop the genome onto this page, and it will upload. Please compress the genome first (e.g. zip, 7-zip, gzip, pkzip, etc) to
save space.

Once you have uploaded something, go to the menu on the top left and click on _Pull requests_ and ask us to add your data to our repo!
