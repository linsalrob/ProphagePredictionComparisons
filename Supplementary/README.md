 - (Sheet 1) Table S1. Genomes provided in the gold-standard library with manually curated prophages

FigureS1.png
 - Figure S1. False positive comparison. Violin plots for each tool show ‘False Positives’ as the number of genes incorrectly labelled prophage genes in each genome. Less is better.

FigureS2.png
 - Figure S2a. F1 scores by genus for each tool. F1 scores are shown for each genome grouped and coloured by genus and separated by prophage caller. 
 - Figure S2b. F1 score distribution for each genus for all tools. Boxplots of F1 scores for each genome over all tools, grouped and coloured by genus. P-values and significance are indicated for Mann-Whitney tests that were performed to determine if a genus had significantly higher or lower F1 scores when compared to the other genera.
