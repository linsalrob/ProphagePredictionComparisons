This folder contains supplementary figures and tables for the manuscript. These will also appear in the Zenodo archive.

SupplementaryTables.xlsx:
 - Table S1 (Sheet 1). Genomes provided in the gold-standard library with manually curated prophages
 - Table S2 (Sheet 2). Prophages identified in the genomes
 - Table S3 (Sheet 3). Mean metrics for each tool as measured from our gold-standard set of genomes

FigureS1.tif:
 - Figure S1. False positive comparison. Violin plots for each tool show ‘False Positives’ as the number of genes 
   incorrectly labelled prophage genes in each genome. Less is better.
