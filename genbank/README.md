# Manually Curated Prophages

We have manually curated these prophages and marked the phage regions in a couple of different ways. 
First, each gene within a prophage region is labelled with the tag `is_phage`. 
Second, the prophage features are actually added to the GenBank file.

To add more genomes to this set, or to suggest corrections, please make a Pull Request. 
We welcome more genomes!
Our guidelines for curating genomes are described in `/Supplementary/prophageAnnotation.md`.

The locations of the prophages that we have identified are available in prophageCoords.tsv, 
as well as in `/Supplementary/SupplementaryTables.xlsx`.
Please submit an issue or pull request if you disagree with these regions.
